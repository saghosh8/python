Here is theList of Que for Python Functions program:

1. Write a program with no arguments passed in function

2. Write a program with  function to find Sum of Two Numbers with no arguments passed

3. Write a program with  function to find Sum of Two Numbers with arguments passed

4. Write a short Python function, is multiple(n, m), that takes two integer
values and returns True if n is a multiple of m, that is, n = mi for some
integer i, and False otherwise.

5.Write a short Python function, is even(k), that takes an integer value and
returns True if k is even, and False otherwise. However, your function
cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators.

6.Write a short Python function, minmax(data), that takes a sequence of
one or more numbers, and returns the smallest and largest numbers, in the
form of a tuple of length two. Do not use the built-in functions min or
max in implementing your solution.
